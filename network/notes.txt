01: IFconfig is used to show or config the networks interface (config is the arrangment of parts or elements)
  :  -l is used for displaying all available interfaces on the system with no other additional information! (interfaces are a point in which a system and machine interact)
  : interface example(the buttons on the front of your television set, for example, are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing)
  : -l is compatable with most ifconfig flags but not with the flag -d (only list interfaces that are down) and -u (only list interfaces that are up)
  
  : lo0: is Loopback interface which is a logical virtual interface in a cisco router. The loopbacks interface IP address determins the OSPF (OPEN SHORTEST PATH FIRST)
  : gif0: is a generic tunnle interface. (tunnle interfaces are firewall interfaces that determine the endpoint of tunnles router based vpns) (Tunneling is the protocall that
  : allows for the secure movment of data from one network to another)  
  : stf0: is a IPV6 to IPV4 tunneling interface. Its a bridge connection to transition from IVP4 to IPV6 standard. Internet protocol version 4 is 32 bit and ipv6 is 128bit based.
  : XHC20 is somthing like usb packet capture
  : en 0 is ethernet port that we are using.
  : p2p0 is a kind of virtual interface to be used for Wi-Fi Direct
  :	apdl stands for apple wireless direct link.

02: Ifconfig then en0 lists all info about ethernet. Then use grep to limit it down to inet, then use awk to print second collum and then use grep -v (void) to block out inet6.

03: So a mac address is a media access control address. It is located in ifconfig  found in en1 ether. So just use ifconfig en1 | grep ether | awk print2

04: A routing table is somthing that stores ip networks and how they can be reached.
